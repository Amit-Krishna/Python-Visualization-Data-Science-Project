## 📂 Dataset Source

- **Source:** [Data.gov.in](https://www.data.gov.in/resource/current-daily-price-various-commodities-various-markets-mandi)
- **Features:** Commodity, State, Market, Variety, Grade, Min/Max/Modal Price, Arrival Date

---

## 🔍 EDA Workflow

1. **Column Renaming** – for readability  
2. **Date Conversion** – formatting for time-based analysis  
3. **Handling Missing Values** – dropped or imputed nulls  
4. **Normalization** – scaled price fields for comparison

## 📊 Key Analysis Objectives

### ✅ Objective 1: Top 10 Commodities by Count
- Tools: `value_counts()`, `sns.barplot()`
- Result: Onion, Tomato, Potato lead

### ✅ Objective 2: Top 10 Markets by Avg Modal Price
- Tools: `groupby()`, `mean()`, `nlargest()`
- Result: Certain markets report higher average prices

### ✅ Objective 3: Correlation Between Prices
- Tools: `corr()`, `sns.heatmap()`
- Result: Modal price is strongly correlated with Max price

### ✅ Objective 4: Histogram of Modal Prices
- Tools: `histplot()`, `isin()`
- Result: Modal prices vary by commodity, Onion peaks high

### ✅ Objective 5: Entry Count per State
- Tools: `value_counts()`, `sns.barplot()`
- Result: Tamil Nadu leads, followed by Kerala and Punjab

### ✅ Objective 6: Pairplot of Price Columns
- Tools: `pairplot()`
- Result: Clear positive relationships between price types

### ✅ Objective 7: Avg Modal Price by Commodity
- Tools: `groupby()`, `mean()`, `sort_values()`
- Result: Kakada, Black Pepper rank high in price

### ✅ Objective 8: Market-wise Modal Price Distribution
- Tools: `boxplot()`
- Result: High variability among certain markets

### ✅ Objective 9: Linear Regression (Max vs Modal Price)
- Tools: `LinearRegression()`, `train_test_split()`
- Result: Strong linear relationship, low MSE
